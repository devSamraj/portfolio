 Challenges Faced & Solutions

 1. Dark Mode Without Breaking Styling
Problem: Applying dark mode while maintaining consistency across the design.
Solution: Implemented CSS variables (`--primary-color`, `--light-color`, etc.) and used a `.dark-mode` class to override them. This made it easy to switch themes without redefining entire styles.

 2. *Responsive Design Across Devices
Problem: Ensuring complex layouts (skills grid, hero text, etc.) look great on all screen sizes.
Solution: Used media queries and CSS Flexbox/Grid for adaptive layouts. Also tested across breakpoints to ensure text, buttons, and images scaled well.

 3. **Maintaining Clean HTML with Many Sections
Problem: Avoiding deeply nested or redundant markup while still having lots of content.
Solution: Structured each section with reusable classes (`.btn`, `.project-Dodomard`, etc.) and semantic elements (`<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`) to keep the document clean and SEO-friendly.
